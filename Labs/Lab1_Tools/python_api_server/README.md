# Exercise on using Python server-side

The directory server_side contains the scripts you need to use with Django; use the instructions on the slide to do it. It creates two APIs:

* set_color?id=id&color=00fff00
where id must be an integer and color must be a six-letter alphanumeric string representing a RGB hex color; returns a json with the current position of the element (randomly assigned)

* get_colors that returns a JSON that lists the current users with their color and position

Remember pythonAnywhere has a limited amount of time people can spend on your servers.
